DataScience.com is providing elastic infrastructure and environment management support for the NSF Big Data Innovation Hub National Transportation Challenge through the DataScience.com Platform. The DataScience.com Platform lets data scientists use their favorite open source tools, like Jupyter, RStudio and Spark, while sharing resources, data, models, and insights in a secure project-based architecture. DataScience.com is proud to participate in this ambitious cross-sector initiative being driven by the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Science Foundation and Regional Big Data Innovation Hubs network, as well as the local and regional government participants and private partnerships.
